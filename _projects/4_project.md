A poster for GIS Day 2021 related to the Millennium Development Goal of Ensuring Environmental Sustainability and related [Story Map](WEBLINK).

Stop reading and check out the Story Map!

**More on this project:** Produced in ArcGIS Pro, this poster presents global carbon intensity data from 1990-2018. The change in carbon intensity is symbolized using scaled arrow symbols. This data suggests some degree of eco-economic decoupling is taking place around the world (in simple terms, "doing more with less"). To raise the question of the adequacy of recent decoupling trends to address the climate crisis, per capita greenhouse gas emissions data over the same period are also presented (yellow-green outline).

**Publication specifications:** 18” x 24” print poster

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.
