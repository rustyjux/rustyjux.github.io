The Big Trout Lake Loop is one of the most popular mid-length (~5 days) canoe routes in Algonquin Park, ON. Having paddling this trip close to a dozen times, I think I could probably pull it off without a map - but why not commemorate the route with a wood lasercut?

Data was imported from OpenStreetMap using [Overpass Turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/), filtered to the area of interest and to remove tiny features in QGIS, and then styled in Adobe Illustrator.
