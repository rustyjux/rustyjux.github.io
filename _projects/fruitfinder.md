I live and play in Rossland, BC. Among the town's many assets are hundreds of fruit trees and more than a few local bears. Annual gleaning days help reduce wildlife attractants and are great community builders. Alas, out-dated paper maps have made these harvest days a bit of a treasure hunt. I produced a custom web app to streamline future gleaning efforts.

<font size="2">Tech notes: In a nutshell, it's a deployment of Esri's Crowdsource Reporter configurable web app on ArcGIS Online. A number of hosted feature layer views allow for varying feature symbology based on values from a related comments table. ArcGIS Online made sense since the City of Rossland is already locked in to the service for a number of other products, as well as allowing for relatively quick (if somewhat limited) deployment.</font><br>
