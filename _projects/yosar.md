This project looked at Yosemite Search and Rescue (YOSAR) incident data, using an array of ArcGIS Pro analysis tools to identify spatial and temporal trends. I leveled up my poster layout design from past efforts, incorporating a nifty landscape image into the poster background and taking better advantage of guides to organize the layout. 

Whether or not I will keep producing posters in ArcGIS Pro or transition to Publisher, Illustrator, InDesign or elsewhere remains to be seen.
