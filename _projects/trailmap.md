This was a volunteer project for [Black Jack Ski Club](http://www.skiblackjack.ca/) to update trail signs, as well as transition away from proprietary software (Esri and Adobe Illustrator) to a free, open-source workflow. This required independently learning QGIS cartography (having only used QGIS for satellite imagery raster processing previously).

These maps required extensive used of rule-based and data-defined symbology and labelling. As well, custom icons were created using Inkscape.
Feature data was drawn from OpenStreepMap, which I help curate and update in our region.

**Publication specifications:** 20” x 12” reflective vinyl signboards
