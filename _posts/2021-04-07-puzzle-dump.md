Sometime in 2019 I was introduced to crossword puzzles via the New Yorker crossword (those puzzles in the Metro tabloid don't count üßê). Sometime shortly thereafter my partner and I started doing the NYT crossword, which really helped make each day exciting and fresh through the pandemic (seriously). It wasn't long until I had the chutzpah to take a crack at making my own puzzles. 

Here are some of those puzzles. My favorites are marked with a star ‚≠ê.
